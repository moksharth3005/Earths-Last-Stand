# Earths Last Stand

The game will feature simple gameplay and great narrative
the story goes like this:
You are training at a super secrete lab to fly the most advanced spacecraft human beings have ever developed
This development took place to stop an evil organization from destroying the Earth
It would be best if you also protected the Earth from asteroids 
As you play more your rank will increase once you reach Admiral rank the secrete lab will inform you about the alien invasion and how to stop it
You can advance from there by buying more power-ups and getting a refueling supply 
Every time you do something to save the earth you get gold 
You can use it to buy power-ups and fuel to maintain orbit
If you fail to stop an attack on Earth the structural integrity of Earth will destabilize and it will explode killing you
If you deorbit then you lose.
